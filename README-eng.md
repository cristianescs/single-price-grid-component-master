## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 custom properties
- CSS Grid
- SASS

### What I learned
I tried to use SASS for the first time to develop it because this could help the website to work with no problems in any navigator, moreover, I've learned CSS Grid and I tried to put into practice for the first time while I was developing this project.
